# 3-minute demo script

Setup (before recording): open `frontend/index.html` straight from disk (saved sample, no server needed), or
`http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html?api=/` for live data. Use a 1440x900 window. In the account menu choose
"Clear demo alerts and cases". Note: the saved sample is from 10 Oct 2026, 3 pm; there were no fires in Punjab that day,
so the story uses the sample's real fires in Jharkhand and Odisha. On the day you record, live data may have Punjab fires.

If the alert does not reach the citizen: the citizen's town must be on that fire's smoke path (Bisoi is for fire `Gamharia`).
