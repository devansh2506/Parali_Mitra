# Parali Mitra (पराली मित्र)

**One platform for the crop-residue problem in India: the farmer who can stop burning, the authority who has to act, and the citizen who breathes the smoke.**

Every October farmers burn straw because the alternatives are unclear, officials cannot see which fires matter, and people downwind find out when the air turns bad. Parali Mitra puts all three on the same data. It was built for the WeMakeDevs x AWS hackathon (8 to 11 October 2026) and runs on AWS.

**Live project: [Parali Mitra](https://d1qht8bqoe1eyl.cloudfront.net)** (the demo may be taken down after the hackathon)

## The three sides

| Login | What it is for |
|---|---|
| **Farmer** (Kissan Sarthi) | The farmer's toolkit: farm, crops, crop doctor, stubble options, no-burn pledge, warnings from authorities |
| **Authority** | A control room: every fire, a smoke map, warn the person behind a fire, alert people downwind, track each case |
| **Citizen** | The air near home now and for 48 hours, whether smoke is coming, health advice, alerts |

They are connected: an authority warns a farmer, the warning appears on the farmer's Warnings page, the farmer taps "I have read this", and the fire's case turns *acknowledged* for the authority. Everything is in English and Hindi (authority screens in English). Logins are demo logins; Amazon Cognito sign-in is prepared but off.

## Kissan Sarthi (किसान सारथी): the farmer's side

| Tool | What the farmer gets |
|---|---|
| **My farm** | Registers the farm (place, land size, soil, irrigation). Sees fires and smoke within 25 km, and warnings from authorities with an "I have read this" button |
| **Crops** | 20 common Indian crops with sowing date, expected harvest and a care guide for the stage the crop is in |
| **Crop doctor** | Ticks what they see (yellow stripes, white powder, stem holes, spots, insects, wilting, pale leaves) and gets the likely problem, organic steps, standard label doses and the Kisan Call Centre number (1800-180-1551) |
| **Stubble** | What burning their straw would release (PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, soot, CO2) and how toxic, plus five better options with cost, gain and support: Pusa bio-decomposer, Happy Seeder, bio-pellets, mushrooms, enriched fodder |
| **No-burn pledge** | Picks an option, takes the pledge and prints a certificate |

Kissan Sarthi exists in two forms:
* **Inside the platform (deployed on AWS):** the Farmer login of the main app. It uses the platform's own pollution numbers, so the farmer's calculator and the authority's fire view agree. A farmer's farm, crops and pledges stay in their browser.
* **The standalone app (`kissan-sarthi/`):** the original Next.js and FastAPI version, live at [kissan-sarthi.vercel.app](https://kissan-sarthi.vercel.app). It adds AI crop analysis and photo diagnosis through Google Gemini when a `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set (built-in defaults otherwise). Run it with `cd kissan-sarthi/frontend && npm install && npm run dev`, and the backend with `uvicorn main:app --port 8001` from `kissan-sarthi/backend`.

Today the two share their purpose and numbers but not a database or a login; the AI features live only in the standalone app. Joining them is the next step: move its AI routes behind the platform API and keep farms, crops and pledges in DynamoDB.

## The fire and air engine (short version)

* **Fires:** NASA satellites (FIRMS, VIIRS) give every hot spot in India for the last 24 hours, about 3 hours behind the satellite.
* **What burned:** a guess from land cover (ESA WorldCover) and, around Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, mapped industry. Each label has a reason.
* **How toxic:** arithmetic, no machine learning: heat strength gives the amount burned, published emission factors (GFED4.1) give what is released, and we compare that with India's safe limits.
* **Smoke path:** Open-Meteo wind on a grid over India moves a point hour by hour, backwards and forwards. It gives direction and timing, not thickness.
* **Air quality:** the Indian AQI is computed in code. Forecast: the CAMS model, 48 hours. Measured: OpenAQ stations, often 2 to 4 days old and marked as such.

## How it is built

```
Browser ──> CloudFront ──┬──> S3 (the web app)
                         └──> API Gateway ──> Lambda (Python 3.12) ──┬──> DynamoDB (alerts, cases)
EventBridge (every 30 min) ──> Lambda "warm" ──────────────────────┴──> S3 (shared cache)
```

AWS services: S3, CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, EventBridge (Cognito and SNS optional, off). The scheduled refresh keeps fires, the wind grid and the air forecast in S3, so visitors get an answer in about 2 seconds instead of waiting about 25. The frontend is plain JavaScript with Leaflet and no build step; the backend uses only the Python standard library.

```
smoke-path/      the platform: src/ (backend), frontend/ (all three roles), scripts/, tests/, template.yaml
kissan-sarthi/   the standalone farmer app (Next.js, FastAPI, Gemini)
```

## Run it

You need Python 3.12 and two free keys in `smoke-path/.env` (gitignored): `FIRMS_MAP_KEY` (firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/api/map_key) and `OPENAQ_API_KEY` (explore.openaq.org/register).

```
cd smoke-path
python3.12 scripts/local_server.py --port 8765      # open http://127.0.0.1:8765/
python3.12 -m unittest discover -s tests            # tests, no network needed
```

Without `?api=` the page runs on saved samples (works offline). See `smoke-path/DEMO_SCRIPT.md` for a 3-minute walk-through.

## Deploy to AWS

One time: `brew install awscli aws-sam-cli`, then `aws configure` (an IAM user's key and your region). Then, now and after every change:

```
cd smoke-path
bash scripts/deploy_aws.sh
```

It builds, deploys the `parali-mitra` stack, uploads the app, clears the CloudFront cache and prints your address (first run about 10 minutes, later runs 2 to 3). Keys go to AWS as hidden parameters. To take it down, empty the two S3 buckets, delete the stack in CloudFormation, then delete the IAM user. Expected cost for a demo is a few dollars at most.

## API

`GET /fires`, `/stations`, `/forecast`, `/air?lat&lon`, `/smoke`; `POST /alerts`, `GET /alerts?lat&lon` (add `&kind=farmer_warnings` for farmers), `POST /alerts/{id}/ack`, `GET /activity`, `GET /cases`, `PATCH /cases/{id}`. With sign-in off, the authority routes are open to anyone with the address: fine for a private demo, enable Cognito (`EnableAuth=true`) before public use.

## Data sources

NASA FIRMS (fires), Open-Meteo and the CAMS forecast by ECMWF (wind, air forecast; free tier, non-commercial), OpenAQ (stations), ESA WorldCover and OpenStreetMap (land cover, industry, places, shipped with the app), Esri (map tiles), GFED4.1 (emission factors), CPCB National Air Quality Index (method and colours). NASA FIRMS and OpenAQ need free keys.

## Honest limits

* Smoke paths give direction and timing, not thickness. Fire type is a guess; factory and kiln fires are only recognised near Delhi, Punjab and Haryana.
* Measured air is often 2 to 4 days old. Villages, schools and hospitals are listed only for the north-west.
* The crop doctor matches ticked symptoms to common problems; it does not analyse photos and is not a diagnosis. Costs and subsidies for straw options are indicative: confirm with the local Krishi Vigyan Kendra.
* Warnings are matched to a farm by distance, not to one named farmer. Demo contacts are fake and the certificate is a demo, not a government document.
* The saved sample is from 10 October 2026, 3 pm (no Punjab fires that day, so the demo uses Jharkhand and Odisha).
